// We want to avoid using the eval() function because it poses a security risk.

//The eval() function is a powerful function in many programming languages
//that allows the execution of arbitrary code.

//However, it can also be a security risk if used improperly.

//When the input to the eval() function comes from an untrusted source, 
//it can lead to code injection attacks, 
//where an attacker can insert malicious code into the program, 
//allowing them to execute arbitrary commands or access sensitive information.

// Additionally, using eval() function can lead to performance issues as it 
//can slow down the execution of the code.

// It's always a best practice to use safer alternatives such as built-in string 
//interpolation or template literals, 
//or using a specific library to avoid any security vulnerabilities and 
//to improve the performance of the application.
